# Kill Switch
## 2025 GMTK Game Jam | Theme: LOOP

Kill Switch is a psychological top-down stealth-assassin game built in 48 hours for the GMTK 2025 Game Jam.  
You’re a sniper with the power to reset time after every failure. Each attempt brings you closer to uncovering  
your true target and the dark truth of the loop you’re trapped in.
