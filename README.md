# Kill Switch
## 2025 GMTK Game Jam | Theme: LOOP

**Kill Switch** is a top-down psychological stealth-assassin game built in 48 hours for the GMTK 2025 Game Jam.  
You’re a professional sniper with access to a mysterious “reset button” that rewinds time every time you fail.  
But the loop isn’t kind every failure warps reality, shifting intel, changing guard patterns, and pushing you closer  
to a truth you can’t escape. Eventually, you abandon the rifle for a close-quarters assassination…  
only to discover that your final target is **yourself**the first version of you who failed the mission.  

> _“Every shot, every reset, every step closer to the inevitable.”_
